This will be a living document that I will update as I learn more about working with me. Im not perfect, can be confrontational but never rude when I have a difference of opinion.

## Values, Principles, and Beliefs

- Context switching is pain
- Iteration Velocity is king to a product
- Growth Mindset
- Vibes are real, trust them
- UX -> DX -> Everything else
- Everyone has a voice, listen.
- You can learn something from everyone -- especially about yourself.
- Strong opinions, weakly held.

## Engineering Style

- I generally want to be involved in everything (Design, Product, Architecture, etc), I'm working on changing this to increase effective personal impact.
- Typesaftey
- Documentation is an art, youll only get better with practice. it also helps you understand deeply

## Communication

- I much prefer voice comms and pair programming
- "Got a second?" - Really think about what you need before asking. Breaking flow is painful

## General

- People Pleaser
- If you need help, ask. I'm working on saying no more so please dont take it personally if i say no.
- I have a strong personality, I promise im nice though


## Personal

- Weightlifting
- Sports official
- Tiny human haver
